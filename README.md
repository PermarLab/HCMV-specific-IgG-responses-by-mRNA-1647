**Summary** 

mRNA-1647 HCMV vaccine elicited polyfunctional and durable antibody responses in humans. While the mRNA-1647-elicited glycoprotein B (gB)-specific IgG responses were lower than that of the moderately-effective gB/MF59 vaccine, the pentameric complex (PC)-specific IgG responses were robust. 

**ABSTRACT** 

**Background**: MF59-adjuvanted gB subunit (gB/MF59) vaccine demonstrated ~50% efficacy against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) acquisition in multiple clinical trials, suggesting efforts to improve this vaccine design might yield a vaccine suitable for licensure. 

**Methods**: An mRNA-based vaccine candidate encoding HCMV gB and pentameric complex (PC), mRNA-1647, is currently in late-stage efficacy trials. Yet, its immunogenicity has not been compared to the partially effective gB/MF59 vaccine. We assessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated IgG effector antibody responses induced by mRNA-1647 in both HCMV seropositive and seronegative vaccinees from a first-in-human clinical trial through 1-year following 3rd vaccination using a systems serology approach. Further, we compared peak anti-gB antibody responses in seronegative mRNA-1647 vaccinees to that of seronegative gB/MF59 vaccine recipients. 

**Results**: mRNA-1647 vaccination elicited and boosted HCMV-specific IgG responses in seronegative and seropositive vaccinees respectively, including neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector antibody responses. gB-specific IgG responses were lower than PC-specific IgG responses. gB-specific IgG and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) responses were lower than those elicited by gB/MF59. However, mRNA-1647 elicited higher neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses. 

**Conclusions**: Overall, mRNA-1647 vaccination induced polyfunctional and durable HCMV-specific antibody responses, with lower gB-specific IgG responses but higher neutralization and ADCC responses compared to the gB/MF59 vaccine.
